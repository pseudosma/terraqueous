# Terraqueous

Proof of concept for features for a game where the player takes care of a planet's ecology with the goal of eventually evolving intelligent life. The player manipulates the lithosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere, and other planetary systems over the course of billions of years to achieve this goal.

## Techniques and Technology

This demonstrates the basic usage of lighting, shaders, bones, and procedural generation in Scene Kit. Terrain, in the form of the world's continents, is randomized on every restart of the app.

## Current status

Very unfinished and pre-alpha.
All that's here now is a sample of the cel shaded asthetic, some attempts at a day - night cycle, and the terrain randomization.
